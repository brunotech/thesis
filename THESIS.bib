We propose a protocol based on quantum long short-term memory (Q-LSTM) for Q-NLP to perform various tasks in general but specifically for translating a sentence from English to Persian. Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages. Our work paves the way toward representing quantum neural machine translation, which may demonstrate quadratic speedup and converge faster or reaches a better accuracy over classical methods.},

This characterization allows a simple demonstration of the compatibility of Frobenius algebra structure with direct sums. We then classify the indecomposable Frobenius algebras as being either “annihilator algebras” — algebras whose socle is a principal ideal — or field extensions. The relationship between two-dimensional topological quantum field theories and Frobenius algebras is then formulated as an equivalence of categories. The proof hinges on our new characterization of Frobenius algebras. These results together provide a classification of the indecomposable two-dimensional topological quantum field theories.},

The coverage is by no means comprehensive, but should provide a good basis for further study; a guide to further reading is included. The main prerequisite is a basic familiarity with the elements of discrete mathematics: sets, relations and functions. An Appendix contains a summary of what we will need, and it may be useful to review this first. In addition, some prior exposure to abstract algebra - vector spaces and linear maps, or groups and group homomorphisms - would be helpful.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant against errors and inaccuracies when \$\textbackslash eta\$, the probability for an error in a qubit or a gate, is smaller than a constant threshold \$\textbackslash eta\_c\$. This result improves on Shor's result [Proceedings of the 37th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, 1996, pp. 56–65], which shows how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation when the error rate \$\textbackslash eta\$ decays polylogarithmically with the size of the computation, an assumption which is physically unreasonable. The cost of making the quantum circuit fault-tolerant in our construction is polylogarithmic in time and space. Our result holds for a very general local noise model, which includes probabilistic errors, decoherence, amplitude damping, depolarization, and systematic inaccuracies in the gates. Moreover, we allow exponentially decaying correlations between the errors both in space and in time. Fault-tolerant computation can be performed with any universal set of gates. The result also holds for quantum particles with \$p{$>$}2\$ states, namely, p-qudits, and is also generalized to one-dimensional quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. We estimate the threshold of our construction to be \$\textbackslash eta\_c\textbackslash simeq 10\^\{-6\}\$, in the best case. By this we show that local noise is in principle not an obstacle for scalable quantum computation. The main ingredient of our proof is the computation on states encoded by a quantum error correcting code (QECC). To this end we introduce a special class of Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) codes, called polynomial codes (the quantum analogue of Reed–Solomon codes). Their nice algebraic structure allows all of the encoded gates to be transversal. We also provide another version of the proof which uses more general CSS codes, but its encoded gates are slightly less elegant. To achieve fault tolerance, we encode the quantum circuit by another circuit by using one of these QECCs. This step is repeated polyloglog many times, each step slightly improving the effective error rate, to achieve the desired reliability. The resulting circuit exhibits a hierarchical structure, and for the analysis of its robustness we borrow terminology from Khalfin and Tsirelson [Found. Phys., 22 (1992), pp. 879–948] and Gács [Advances in Computing Research: A Research Annual: Randomness and Computation, JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, 1989]. The paper is to a large extent self-contained. In particular, we provide simpler proofs for many of the known results we use, such as the fact that it suffices to correct for bit-flips and phase-flips, the correctness of CSS codes, and the fact that two-qubit gates are universal, together with their extensions to higher-dimensional particles. We also provide full proofs of the universality of the sets of gates we use (the proof of universality was missing in Shor's paper). This paper thus provides a self-contained and complete proof of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of local noise.},

All bounds on \$\textbackslash omega\$ since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the `value' of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on \$\textbackslash omega\$, and we indeed obtain the best bound on \$\textbackslash omega\$ to date: \$\$\textbackslash omega {$<$} 2.37286.\$\$ The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12].

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {Translations between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based one-way model are useful for verification and optimisation of quantum computations. They make crucial use of a property known as gflow. While gflow is defined for one-way computations allowing measurements in three different planes of the Bloch sphere, most research so far has focused on computations containing only measurements in the XY-plane. Here, we give the first circuit-extraction algorithm to work for one-way computations containing measurements in all three planes and having gflow. The algorithm is efficient and the resulting circuits do not contain ancillae. One-way computations are represented using the ZX-calculus, hence the algorithm also represents the most general known procedure for extracting circuits from ZX-diagrams. In developing this algorithm, we generalise several concepts and results previously known for computations containing only XY-plane measurements. We bring together several known rewrite rules for measurement patterns and formalise them in a unified notation using the ZX-calculus. These rules are used to simplify measurement patterns by reducing the number of qubits while preserving both the semantics and the existence of gflow. The results can be applied to circuit optimisation by translating circuits to patterns and back again.},

  abstract = {Part of the difficulty of combining general relativity and quantum theory is that they use different sorts of mathematics: one is based on objects such as manifolds, the other on objects such as Hilbert spaces. As ‘sets equipped with extra structure’, these look like very different things, so combining them in a single theory has always seemed a bit like trying to mix oil and water. However, work on topological quantum field theory has uncovered a deep analogy between the two. Moreover, this analogy operates at the level of categories. This chapter focuses on two categories. One is the category Hilb whose objects are Hilbert spaces and whose morphisms are linear operators between these. This plays an important role in quantum theory. The other is the category nCob whose objects are (n — 1)-dimensional manifolds and whose morphisms are n-dimensional manifolds going between these. This plays an important role in relativistic theories where spacetime is assumed to be n-dimensional: in these theories the objects of nCob represent possible choices of ‘space’, while the morphisms — called ‘cobordisms’ — represent possible choices of ‘spacetime’.},

  abstract = {Control theory uses "signal-flow diagrams" to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinVect\_k of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s), where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. For any field k we give a presentation of FinVect\_k in terms of the generators used in signal flow diagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes "caps" and "cups" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinRel\_k, where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We also give a presentation for FinRel\_k. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the "ZX-calculus" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases.},

  abstract = {Reaction networks, or equivalently Petri nets, are a general framework for describing processes in which entities of various kinds interact and turn into other entities. In chemistry, where the reactions are assigned "rate constants", any reaction network gives rise to a nonlinear dynamical system called its "rate equation". Here we generalize these ideas to "open" reaction networks, which allow entities to flow in and out at certain designated inputs and outputs. We treat open reaction networks as morphisms in a category. Composing two such morphisms connects the outputs of the first to the inputs of the second. We construct a functor sending any open reaction network to its corresponding "open dynamical system". This provides a compositional framework for studying the dynamics of reaction networks. We then turn to statics: that is, steady state solutions of open dynamical systems. We construct a "black-boxing" functor that sends any open dynamical system to the relation that it imposes between input and output variables in steady states. This extends our earlier work on black-boxing for Markov processes.},

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of \$\textbackslash NP\$ can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \$\textbackslash NP\$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine (QTM) in time \$o(2\^\{n/2\})\$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \$\textbackslash NP \textbackslash cap \textbackslash coNP\$ cannot be solved on a QTM in time \$o(2\^\{n/3\})\$. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover [in \{\textbackslash it Proc.\textbackslash{} \$28\$th Annual ACM Symposium Theory Comput.\}, 1996] shows how to accept the class \$\textbackslash NP\$ relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time \$O(2\^\{n/2\})\$.},

A plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, Qiskit, Cirq, and ProjectQ, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible quantum devices provided by Rigetti and IBM Q.

  abstract = {String diagrams are a powerful and intuitive graphical syntax for terms of symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). They find many applications in computer science and are becoming increasingly relevant in other fields such as physics and control theory. An important role in many such approaches is played by equational theories of diagrams, typically oriented and applied as rewrite rules. This paper lays a comprehensive foundation of this form of rewriting. We interpret diagrams combinatorially as typed hypergraphs and establish the precise correspondence between diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs on the one hand and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of hypergraphs, subject to a soundness condition called convexity, on the other. This result rests on a more general characterisation theorem in which we show that typed hypergraph DPO rewriting amounts to diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs with a chosen special Frobenius structure. We illustrate our approach with a proof of termination for the theory of non-commutative bimonoids.},

  abstract = {The Calculus of Conjunctive Queries (CCQ) has foundational status in database theory. A celebrated theorem of Chandra and Merlin states that CCQ query inclusion is decidable. Its proof transforms logical formulas to graphs: each query has a natural model - a kind of graph - and query inclusion reduces to the existence of a graph homomorphism between natural models. We introduce the diagrammatic language Graphical Conjunctive Queries (GCQ) and show that it has the same expressivity as CCQ. GCQ terms are string diagrams, and their algebraic structure allows us to derive a sound and complete axiomatisation of query inclusion, which turns out to be exactly Carboni and Walters' notion of cartesian bicategory of relations. Our completeness proof exploits the combinatorial nature of string diagrams as (certain cospans of) hypergraphs: Chandra and Merlin's insights inspire a theorem that relates such cospans with spans. Completeness and decidability of the (in)equational theory of GCQ follow as a corollary. Categorically speaking, our contribution is a model-theoretic completeness theorem of free cartesian bicategories (on a relational signature) for the category of sets and relations.},

  abstract = {String diagrams are a powerful and intuitive graphical syntax, originated in the study of symmetric monoidal categories. In the last few years, they have found application in the modelling of various computational structures, in fields as diverse as Computer Science, Physics, Control Theory, Linguistics, and Biology. In many such proposals, the transformations of the described systems are modelled as rewrite rules of diagrams. These developments demand a mathematical foundation for string diagram rewriting: whereas rewrite theory for terms is well-understood, the two-dimensional nature of string diagrams poses additional challenges. This work systematises and expands a series of recent conference papers laying down such foundation. As first step, we focus on the case of rewrite systems for string diagrammatic theories which feature a Frobenius algebra. This situation ubiquitously appear in various approaches: for instance, in the algebraic semantics of linear dynamical systems, Frobenius structures model the wiring of circuits; in categorical quantum mechanics, they model interacting quantum observables. Our work introduces a combinatorial interpretation of string diagram rewriting modulo Frobenius structures, in terms of double-pushout hypergraph rewriting. Furthermore, we prove this interpretation to be sound and complete. In the last part, we also see that the approach can be generalised to model rewriting modulo multiple Frobenius structures. As a proof of concept, we show how to derive from these results a termination strategy for Interacting Bialgebras, an important rewrite theory in the study of quantum circuits and signal flow graphs.},

For standard DPO rewriting without interfaces, confluence for terminating rewrite systems is, in general, undecidable. Nevertheless, we show here that confluence for DPOI, and hence string diagram rewriting, is decidable. We apply this result to give effective procedures for deciding local confluence of symmetric monoidal theories with and without Frobenius structure by critical pair analysis. For the latter, we introduce the new notion of path joinability for critical pairs, which enables finitely many joins of a critical pair to be lifted to an arbitrary context in spite of the strong non-local constraints placed on rewriting in a generic symmetric monoidal theory.},

  abstract = {Symmetric monoidal theories (SMTs) generalise algebraic theories in a way that make them suitable to express resource-sensitive systems, in which variables cannot be copied or discarded at will. In SMTs, traditional tree-like terms are replaced by string diagrams, topological entities that can be intuitively thoughts as diagrams of wires and boxes. Recently, string diagrams have become increasingly popular as a graphical syntax to reason about computational models across diverse fields, including programming language semantics, circuit theory, quantum mechanics, linguistics, and control theory. In applications, it is often convenient to implement the equations appearing in SMTs as rewriting rules. This poses the challenge of extending the traditional theory of term rewriting, which has been developed for algebraic theories, to string diagrams. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of string diagram rewriting for SMTs. Our approach exploits the correspondence between string diagram rewriting and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of certain graphs, introduced in the first paper of this series. Such a correspondence is only sound when the SMT includes a Frobenius algebra structure. In the present work, we show how an analogous correspondence may be established for arbitrary SMTs, once an appropriate notion of DPO rewriting (which we call convex) is identified. As proof of concept, we use our approach to show termination of two SMTs of interest: Frobenius semi-algebras and bialgebras.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$ such that \$A |0\textbackslash rangle= \textbackslash sum\_\{x\textbackslash in X\} \textbackslash alpha\_x |x\textbackslash rangle\$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of \$X\$, and let \$a\$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if \$A |0\textbackslash rangle\$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running \$A\$, measuring the output, and using \$\textbackslash chi\$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat \$1/a\$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good \$x\$ after an expected number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{a\}\$, assuming algorithm \$A\$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which \$A\$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of \$X\$ and we had a promise that a single \$x\$ existed such that \$\textbackslash chi(x)=1\$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of \$a\$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of \$a\$ is known, we can find a good \$x\$ after a number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{a\}\$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of \$a\$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of \$x\textbackslash in X\$ such that \$\textbackslash chi(x)=1\$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

We also show how this framework can be used to represent CSS codes and conversely how to compute stabilisers for a CPC code. We give a construction turns (almost) any pair of classical [n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code, and give a straightforward technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes.

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  abstract = {Language is the currency of most human social processes. We use words to convey our emotions and thoughts, to tell stories, and to understand the world. It is somewhat odd, then, that so few investigations in the social sciences actually focus on natural language use among people in the real world. There are many legitimate reasons for not studying what people say or write. Historically, the analysis of text was slow, complex, and costly. The purpose of this chapter is to suggest that social scientists in general and social psychologists in particular should reconsider the value of language studies. With recent advances in computer text analysis methods, we are now able to explore basic social processes in new and rich ways that could not have been done even a decade ago. When language has been studied at all within social psychology, it has usually relied on fairly rigorous experimental methods using an assortment of standardized human coding procedures. These works are helping researchers to understand social attribution (Fiedler \& Semin, 1992), intercultural communication (Hajek \& Giles, 2003), and even how different cultures think about time (Boroditsky, 2001).}

To do so, we exploited the perfect structural match of grammar and categories of meaning spaces. Here, we give a mathematical foundation, referred to as DisCoCirc, for how sentences interact in texts in order to produce the meaning of that text. First we revisit DisCoCat. While in DisCoCat all meanings are fixed as states (i.e. have no input), in DisCoCirc word meanings correspond to a type, or system, and the states of this system can evolve. Sentences are gates within a circuit which update the variable meanings of those words. Like in DisCoCat, word meanings can live in a variety of spaces e.g. propositional, vectorial, or cognitive. The compositional structure are string diagrams representing information flows, and an entire text yields a single string diagram in which word meanings lift to the meaning of an entire text. While the developments in this paper are independent of a physical embodiment (cf. classical vs. quantum computing), both the compositional formalism and suggested meaning model are highly quantum-inspired, and implementation on a quantum computer would come with a range of benefits. We also praise Jim Lambek for his role in mathematical linguistics in general, and the development of the DisCo program more specifically.},

Using a general categorical formulation, we show that pairs of mutually unbiased quantum observables form bialgebra-like structures. We also provide an abstract account on the quantum data encoded in complex phases, and prove a normal form theorem for it. Together these enable us to describe all observables of finite dimensional Hilbert space quantum mechanics. The resulting equations suffice to perform computations with elementary quantum gates, translate between distinct quantum computational models, establish the equivalence of entangled quantum states, and simulate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform. All these computations moreover happen within an intuitive diagrammatic calculus.},

The diagrammatic framework is stated in the graphical language of symmetric monoidal categories and of compact structures and Frobenius structures therein, in which Bayesian inversion boils down to transposition with respect to an appropriate compact structure. We characterize classical Bayesian inference in terms of a graphical property and demonstrate that our approach eliminates some purely conventional elements that appear in common representations thereof, such as whether degrees of belief are represented by probabilities or entropic quantities. We also introduce a quantum-like calculus wherein the Frobenius structure is noncommutative and show that it can accommodate Leifer's calculus of `conditional density operators'. The notion of conditional independence is also generalized to our graphical setting and we make some preliminary connections to the theory of Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct a graphical Bayesian calculus within any dagger compact category.},

At their most benign, these repositories of forbidden knowledge revealed how to make powerful talismans and protective amulets, and provided charms and conjurations for healing illness, finding love, and warding off evil. But other books promised the power to control innocent victims, even to call up the devil. Davies traces the history of this remarkably resilient and adaptable genre, from the ancient Middle East to modern America, offering a new perspective on the fundamental developments of western civilization over the past two thousand years. Grimoires shows the influence magic and magical writing has had on the cultures of the world, richly demonstrating the role they have played in the spread of Christianity, the growth of literacy, and the influence of western traditions from colonial times to the present.},

  abstract = {In fault-tolerant quantum computing systems, realising (approximately) universal quantum computation is usually described in terms of realising Clifford+T operations, which is to say a circuit of CNOT, Hadamard, and \$\textbackslash pi/2\$-phase rotations, together with T operations (\$\textbackslash pi/4\$-phase rotations). For many error correcting codes, fault-tolerant realisations of Clifford operations are significantly less resource-intensive than those of T gates, which motivates finding ways to realise the same transformation involving T-count (the number of T gates involved) which is as low as possible. Investigations into this problem [arXiv:1206.0758, 1303.2042, 1308.4134, 1601.07363, 1606.01904, 1701.00140] has led to observations that this problem is closely related to NP-hard tensor decomposition problems [arXiv:1712.01557] and is tantamount to the difficult problem of decoding exponentially long Reed-Muller codes [arXiv:1601.07363]. This problem then presents itself as one for which must be content in practise with approximate optimisation, in which one develops an array of tactics to be deployed through some pragmatic strategy. In this vein, we describe techniques to reduce the T-count, based on the effective application of "spider nest identities": easily recognised products of parity-phase operations which are equivalent to the identity operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such techniques by obtaining improvements in the T-counts of a number of circuits, in run-times which are typically less than the time required to make a fresh cup of coffee.},

Then, using the rules of the ZX-calculus, we give a simplification strategy for ZX-diagrams based on the two graph transformations of local complementation and pivoting and show that the resulting reduced diagram can be transformed back into a quantum circuit. While little is known about extracting circuits from arbitrary ZX-diagrams, we show that the underlying graph of our simplified ZX-diagram always has a graph-theoretic property called generalised flow, which in turn yields a deterministic circuit extraction procedure. For Clifford circuits, this extraction procedure yields a new normal form that is both asymptotically optimal in size and gives a new, smaller upper bound on gate depth for nearest-neighbour architectures. For Clifford+T and more general circuits, our technique enables us to to `see around' gates that obstruct the Clifford structure and produce smaller circuits than naive 'cut-and-resynthesise' methods.},

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

However, there is a strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols, being the first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols will certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a survey that aims to draw the link between symbolic representations and distributed/distributional representations. This is the right time to revitalize the area of interpreting how symbols are represented inside neural networks.},

Lenses may be symmetric or asymmetric, and may be composed, forming the morphisms of a monoidal category. More recently, the notion of a learner has been proposed: these provide a compositional way of modelling supervised learning algorithms, and again form the morphisms of a monoidal category. In this paper, we show that the two concepts are tightly linked. We show both that there is a faithful, identity-on-objects symmetric monoidal functor embedding a category of asymmetric lenses into the category of learners, and furthermore there is such a functor embedding the category of learners into a category of symmetric lenses.},

Here, this approach is advanced by stating and proving equivalent conditions for second-order stochastic dominance, a widely used way of comparing probability distributions by their spread. Furthermore, we lay foundation for the theory of comparing statistical experiments within Markov categories by stating and proving the classical Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem. Our version not only offers new insight into the proof, but its abstract nature also makes the result more general, automatically specializing to the standard Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem in measure-theoretic probability as well as a Bayesian version that involves prior-dependent garbling. Along the way, we define and characterize representable Markov categories, within which one can talk about Markov kernels to or from spaces of distributions. We do so by exploring the relation between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of probability monads.},

  abstract = {Explaining the variation between human languages and the constraints on that variation is a core goal of linguistics. In the last 20 y, it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency length—the distance between syntactically related words in a sentence—is minimized. Various models of human sentence production and comprehension predict that long dependencies are difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length thus enables effective communication without incurring processing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized in real utterances across many languages; previous work has focused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 diverse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is a universal quantitative property of human languages and support explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties of human information processing.},

A grammar is a system of rules by means of which those strings which belong to the language (i.e., are sentences) are defined. Two types of grammars are dealt with-those based on dependency rules and those based on phrase-structure rules. Both of these supply the sentences that they analyze with additional structure; there is a very close relationship between these structures. Different notions of equivalence between grammars of the two types, based on structure similarities, are defined. Every dependency system has a “naturally corresponding≓ phrase-structure system but not vice versa. An effective necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a “naturally corresponding≓ dependency system for a given phrase-structure system is given, and an effective way to construct it when it exists. Nevertheless, every set of strings defined by means of a grammar of one type is also defined by means of a grammar of the other type, which can be found effectively. However, the result above implies that there will be cases in which the second system will not be “naturally correlated≓ with the given one from a structural point of view.},

A compositional approach potentially allows methods of game theory and theoretical computer science to be applied to large-scale economic models for which standard economic tools are not practical. An open game represents a game played relative to an arbitrary environment and to this end we introduce the concept of coutility, which is the utility generated by an open game and returned to its environment. Open games are the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category and can therefore be composed by categorical composition into sequential move games and by monoidal products into simultaneous move games. Open games can be represented by string diagrams which provide an intuitive but formal visualisation of the information flows. We show that a variety of games can be faithfully represented as open games in the sense of having the same Nash equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses.},

Our layouts account for distillation and routing, are based on plausible physical assumptions for a large-scale superconducting qubit platform, and suggest that circuit-level Toffoli parallelism (e.g. using a carry-lookahead adder instead of a ripple-carry adder) will not reduce the execution time of computations involving fewer than five million physical qubits. We reduce the spacetime volume of delayed choice CZs by a factor of 4 compared to techniques from previous work (Fowler 2012), and make several improvements to the CCZ magic state factory from (Gidney 2019).},

Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.},

  abstract = {Categorical quantum mechanics places finite-dimensional quantum theory in the context of compact closed categories, with an emphasis on diagrammatic reasoning. In this framework, two equational diagrammatic calculi have been proposed for pure-state qubit quantum computing: the ZW calculus, developed by Coecke, Kissinger and the first author for the purpose of qubit entanglement classification, and the ZX calculus, introduced by Coecke and Duncan to give an abstract description of complementary observables. Neither calculus, however, provided a complete axiomatisation of their model. In this paper, we present extended versions of ZW and ZX, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory, thus solving two major open problems in categorical quantum mechanics. First, we extend the original ZW calculus to represent states and linear maps with coefficients in an arbitrary commutative ring, and prove completeness by a strategy that rewrites all diagrams into a normal form. We then extend the language and axioms of the original ZX calculus, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory through a translation between ZX and ZW specialised to the field of complex numbers. This translation expands the one used by Jeandel, Perdrix, and Vilmart to derive an axiomatisation of the approximately universal Clifford+T fragment; restricting the field of complex numbers to a suitable subring, we obtain an alternative axiomatisation of the same theory.},

  abstract = {NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility mades NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for eash exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdoes-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models, are included. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},

  abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

Specifically they have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a ‘partial’ duality that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a ‘teleological category’. We precisely define a diagrammatic language suitable for these categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of diagrammatic reasoning in compositional game theory, which has previously been used only informally.},

  abstract = {Monoidal category theory serves as a powerful framework for describing logical aspects of quantum theory, giving an abstract language for parallel and sequential composition and a conceptual way to understand many high-level quantum phenomena. Here, we lay the foundations for this categorical quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the graphical calculus that makes computation intuitive. We describe superposition and entanglement using biproducts and dual objects, and show how quantum teleportation can be studied abstractly using these structures. We investigate monoids, Frobenius structures and Hopf algebras, showing how they can be used to model classical information and complementary observables. We describe the CP construction, a categorical tool to describe probabilistic quantum systems. The last chapter introduces higher categories, surface diagrams and 2-Hilbert spaces, and shows how the language of duality in monoidal 2-categories can be used to reason about quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation and dense coding. Previous knowledge of linear algebra, quantum information or category theory would give an ideal background for studying this text, but it is not assumed, with essential background material given in a self-contained introductory chapter. Throughout the text, we point out links with many other areas, such as representation theory, topology, quantum algebra, knot theory and probability theory, and present nonstandard models including sets and relations. All results are stated rigorously and full proofs are given as far as possible, making this book an invaluable reference for modern techniques in quantum logic, with much of the material not available in any other textbook.},

In this article the de-caying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradients are briefly discussed.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {In recent years, developments in machine learning had a tremendous impact on Natural  Language Processing (NLP). However, state-of-the-art language models contain  billions of parameters that require vast computational resources for optimization and  capture syntactic rules only from data, which does not allow an extensive analysis  of the underlying logic of language. Hence, to reduce the parameter space of NLP  models and close the gap between logic-based language models and statistical vector  space models, Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark [11] introduce a compound framework  called Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning, based on Lambeks Pregroup  grammar and Quantum Theory.  This thesis investigates applying the Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning  on the word-sense disambiguation task by Kartsaklis, Sadrzadeh, and Pulman  [18]. Different quantum embeddings are evaluated in terms of disambiguation power,  given a matching context. One focus lies on the description of ambiguous words as  mixed states. Mixed states are probabilistic quantum states expressed as density  matrices which entail a lack of knowledge about the underlying system. Empirical  data was gathered from experiments using quantum circuits and classical computations.  We evaluate the performance and discuss the challenges and limitations of the  current quantum computing models. The results confirm the comprehensiveness of  the Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning and show statistical indications  for a richer representation of words by density matrices.},

We make the ZX-Calculus, a diagrammatic language introduced by Coecke and Duncan, complete for the so-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics by adding two new axioms to the language. The completeness of the ZX-Calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics -- also called the π/4-fragment of the ZX-Calculus -- was one of the main open questions in categorical quantum mechanics. We prove the completeness of this fragment using the recently studied ZW-Calculus, a calculus dealing with integer matrices. We also prove that the π/4-fragment of the ZX-Calculus represents exactly all the matrices over some finite dimensional extension of the ring of dyadic rationals.},

This paper provides evidence that the addition of a vector disambiguation step prior to the actual composition would be beneficial to the whole process, producing better composite representations. Furthermore, we relate this issue with the current evaluation practice, showing that disambiguation-based tasks cannot reliably assess the quality of composition. Using a word sense disambiguation scheme based on the generic procedure of Schütze (1998), we first provide a proof of concept for the necessity of separating disambiguation from composition. Then we demonstrate the benefits of an “unambiguous” system on a composition-only task.},

The information is modeled as an \$m \textbackslash times n\$ preference matrix which is assumed to have a good rank-\$k\$ approximation, for a small constant \$k\$. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time \$O(\textbackslash text\{poly\}(k)\textbackslash text\{polylog\}(mn))\$. All known classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application.},

Unlike prior constructions within categorical quantum mechanics, the objects of this theory encode fine-grained causal relationships between subsystems and give a new method for expressing and deriving consequences for a broad class of causal structures. We show that this framework enables one to define families of processes which are consistent with arbitrary acyclic causal orderings. In particular, one can define one-way signalling (a.k.a. semi-causal) processes, non-signalling processes, and quantum \$n\$-combs. Furthermore, our framework is general enough to accommodate recently-proposed generalisations of classical and quantum theory where processes only need to have a fixed causal ordering locally, but globally allow indefinite causal ordering. To illustrate this point, we show that certain processes of this kind, such as the quantum switch, the process matrices of Oreshkov, Costa, and Brukner, and a classical three-party example due to Baumeler, Feix, and Wolf are all instances of a certain family of processes we refer to as \$\textbackslash textrm\{SOC\}\_n\$ in the appropriate category of higher-order causal processes. After defining these families of causal structures within our framework, we give derivations of their operational behaviour using simple, diagrammatic axioms.},

  abstract = {Reducing the number of non-Clifford quantum gates present in a circuit is an important task for efficiently implementing quantum computations, especially in the fault-tolerant regime. We present a new method for reducing the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit based on the ZX-calculus, which matches or beats previous approaches to T-count reduction on the majority of our benchmark circuits in the ancilla-free case, in some cases yielding up to 50\% improvement. Our method begins by representing the quantum circuit as a ZX-diagram, a tensor network-like structure that can be transformed and simplified according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a recently-proposed simplification strategy can be extended to reduce T-count using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows non-Clifford phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary non-Clifford phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simplification strategy we use is powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.},

  abstract = {"Meaning " may be assigned to a string in a context-free language by defining "at-tributes " of the symbols in a derivation tree for that string. The attributes can be de-fined by functions associated with each production in the grammar. This paper examines the implications of this process when some of the attributes are "synthe-sized", i.e., defined solely in terms of attributes of the descendants of the correspond-ing nonterminal symbol, while other attributes are "inherited", i.e., defined in terms of attributes of the ancestors of the nonterminal symbol. An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature. A simple technique for specifying the "meaning " of languages defined by context-free grammars is introduced in Section 1 of this paper, and its basic mathematical properties are investigated in Sections 2 and 3. An example which indicates how the technique can be applied to the formal definition of programming languages i described in Section 4, and finally, Section 5 contains a somewhat biased comparison of the present method to other known techniques for semantic definition. The discussion in this paper is oriented primarily towards programming languages, but the same methods appear to be relevant also in the study of natural anguages. 1. Introduction. Let},

  abstract = {At first sight, it seems quite unlikely that mathematics can be applied to the study of natural language. However, upon closer examination, it appears that language itself is a kind of mathematics: producing and recognizing speech involves calculations, albeit at a subconscious level, and the rules of grammar which the speaker has mastered, even if she cannot formulate them, resemble the axioms and rules of inference of mathematical logic. In this article I will present an algebraic model of grammar in the form of a pregroup, which competes with an earlier model which was once proposed by me and is now being developed further by a small but dedicated group of researchers, and took the form of a residuated monoid . I am not fully convinced that either of these models really captures the cognitive processes involved, and I still suspect that rewrite systems, also known as production grammars, do a better job. Yet the algebraic models offer an alternative approach of interest to the more mathematically inclined students of language. Although I have told this story before (Lambek, 1999), the present version is addressed to linguists, hence some mathematical definitions have been deferred to an appendix and proofs have been left out altogether. While some red herrings have been eliminated (protogroups, inflectors), the small fragment of English grammar treated here is essentially the same as in the earlier version.},

  abstract = {Ideally, the grammar of a language should tell us whkh sequences of words form sentences and which sequences don’t. It is doubtful whether any existing grammar achieves this end for one of the natural languages, such as English, Russian or Chinese. However, logicians have constructed certain artificial languages (e. g. the prepositional calculus) together with a set of rules which distinguish between sentences (or well-formed formulas, as logicians prefer to call them) and non-sentences. While it is premature to attempt a complete description of English, partial grammars have been constructed.                            In this paper we shall consider a fragment of English containing the names               John               and               Jane               , the verbs               must, work, call, have, be               , the adverb               today               , the conjunctions               but               and               while               and a few other words of the same types. We also admit inflected forms such as               works, worked, working               , etc. We shall attempt to-decide which sequences of these word-forms are sentences and which are not. Our grammar, if successful, must tell us that “John must have been calling Jane today” is a sentence, and that “John has must call Jane” is not a sentence. However, we may as well admit that many sentences will escape our net, owing to the fact that certain constructions, e. g. the gerund, will not be considered here.},

We explore the assignment of elements of a free protogroup to English words as an aid for checking which strings of words are well-formed sentences, though ultimately we may have to relax the requirement of freeness. By a pregroup we mean a protogroup which also satisfies 1 ≤aa and 1 ≤a r a, rendering a a left adjoint and a r a right adjoint of a. A pregroup is precisely a poset model of classical non-commutative linear logic in which the tensor product coincides with it dual. This last condition is crucial to our treatment of passives and Wh-questions, which exploits the fact that a ≠a in general. Free pregroups may be used to recognize the same sentences as free protogroups.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the Moore-Segal axioms for an open-closed topological field theory, we consider planar open string topological field theories. We rigorously define a category 2Thick whose objects and morphisms can be thought of as open strings and diffeomorphism classes of planar open string worldsheets. Just as the category of 2-dimensional cobordisms can be described as the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative Frobenius algebra, 2Thick is shown to be the free monoidal category on a noncommutative Frobenius algebra, hence justifying this choice of data in the Moore-Segal axioms. Our formalism is inherently categorical allowing us to generalize this result. As a stepping stone towards topological membrane theory we define a 2-category of open strings, planar open string worldsheets, and isotopy classes of 3-dimensional membranes defined by diffeomorphisms of the open string worldsheets. This 2-category is shown to be the free (weak monoidal) 2-category on a `categorified Frobenius algebra', meaning that categorified Frobenius algebras determine invariants of these 3-dimensional membranes.},

  abstract = {In the mathematical development of recent decades one sees clearly the rise of the conviction that the relevant properties of mathematical objects are those which can be stated in terms of their abstract structure rather than in terms of the elements which the objects were thought to be made of. The question thus naturally arises whether one can give a foundation for mathematics which expresses wholeheartedly this conviction concerning what mathematics is about, and in particular in which classes and membership in classes do not play any role. Here by “foundation” we mean a single system of first-order axioms in which all usual mathematical objects can be defined and all their usual properties proved. A foundation of the sort we have in mind would seemingly be much more natural and readily-useable than the classical one when developing such subjects as algebraic topology, functional analysis, model theory of general algebraic systems, etc. Clearly any such foundation would have to reckon with the Eilenberg-MacLane theory of categories and functors. The author believes, in fact, that the most reasonable way to arrive at a foundation meeting these requirements is simply to write down axioms descriptive of properties which the intuitively-conceived category of all categories has until an intuitively-adequate list is attained; that is essentially how the theory described below was arrived at. Various metatheorems should of course then be proved to help justify the feeling of adequacy.},

Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke et al.

We use these representations to implement and successfully train two NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We describe in detail the main principles, the process and challenges of these experiments, in a way accessible to NLP researchers, thus paving the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing.},

  abstract = {Bob Coecke is a celebrated physicist, he's been a Physics and Quantum professor at Oxford University for the last 20 years. He is particularly interested in Structure which is to say, Logic, Order, and Category Theory. He is well known for work involving compositional distributional models of natural language meaning and he is also fascinated with understanding how our brains work. Bob was recently appointed as the Chief Scientist at Cambridge Quantum Computing. Bob thinks that interactions between systems in Quantum Mechanics carries naturally over to how word meanings interact in natural language. Bob argues that this interaction embodies the phenomenon of quantum teleportation. Bob invented ZX-calculus, a graphical calculus for revealing the compositional structure inside quantum circuits - to show entanglement states and protocols in a visually succinct but logically complete way. Von Neumann himself didn't even like his own original symbolic formalism of quantum theory, despite it being widely used! We hope you enjoy this fascinating conversation which might give you a lot of insight into natural language processing.  Pod: https://anchor.fm/machinelearningstre...

  abstract = {Many experimental proposals for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices involve training a parameterized quantum circuit with a classical optimization loop. Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

  abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is at the forefront of great advances in contemporary AI, and it is arguably one of the most challenging areas of the field. At the same time, with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides a new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. Earlier work has already demonstrated a potential quantum advantage for NLP in a number of manners: (i) algorithmic speedups for search-related or classification tasks, which are the most dominant tasks within NLP, (ii) exponentially large quantum state spaces allow for accommodating complex linguistic structures, (iii) novel models of meaning employing density matrices naturally model linguistic phenomena such as hyponymy and linguistic ambiguity, among others. In this work, we perform the first implementation of an NLP task on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits. We encode word-meanings in quantum states and we explicitly account for grammatical structure, which even in mainstream NLP is not commonplace, by faithfully hard-wiring it as entangling operations. This makes our approach to quantum natural language processing (QNLP) particularly NISQ-friendly. Our novel QNLP model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum hardware improves in the near future.},

In principle, this graphical notation should encompass the various pictorial systems introduced in proof-theory (like Jean-Yves Girard’s proof-nets) and in concurrency theory (like Robin Milner’s bigraphs). This is not the case however, at least because string diagrams do not accomodate boxes — a key ingredient in these pictorial systems. In this short tutorial, based on our accidental rediscovery of an idea by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, we explain how string diagrams may be extended with a notion of functorial box depicting a functor transporting an inside world (its source category) to an outside world (its target category). We expose two elementary applications of the notation: first, we characterize graphically when a faithful balanced monoidal functor F:ℂ ⟶⟶\textbackslash longrightarrow 𝔻D\textbackslash mathbb\{D\} transports a trace operator from the category 𝔻D\textbackslash mathbb\{D\} to the category ℂ, and exploit this to construct well-behaved fixpoint operators in cartesian closed categories generated by models of linear logic; second, we explain how the categorical semantics of linear logic induces that the exponential box of proof-nets decomposes as two enshrined boxes.},

Besides revealing dualities which are not immediately apparent in the traditional presentation of the presheaf hyperdoctrine, this reconstruction leads us to an axiomatic treatment of directed equality predicates (modelled by hom presheaves), realizing a vision initially set out by Lawvere (1970). It also leads to a simple calculus of string diagrams (representing presheaves) that is highly reminiscent of C. S. Peirce's existential graphs for predicate logic, refining an earlier interpretation of existential graphs in terms of Boolean hyperdoctrines by Brady and Trimble. Finally, we illustrate how this work extends to a bifibrational setting a number of fundamental ideas of linear logic.},

  abstract = {There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music, in particular for musical composition and access to large databases for commercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system.},

  abstract = {In this report, certain properties of context-free (CF or type 2) grammars are investigated, like that of Chomsky. In particular, questions regarding structure, possible ambiguity and relationship to finite automata are considered. The following results are presented: The language generated by a context-free grammmar is linear in a sense that is defined precisely. The requirement of unambiguity—that every sentence has a unique phrase structure—weakens the grammar in the sense that there exists a CF language that cannot be generated unambiguously by a CF grammar. The result that not every CF language is a finite automaton (FA) language is improved in the following way. There exists a CF language L such that for any L′ ⊆ L, if L′ is FA, an L″ ⊆ L can be found such that L″ is also FA, L′ ⊆ L″ and L″ contains infinitely many sentences not in L′. A type of grammar is defined that is intermediate between type 1 and type 2 grammars. It is shown that this type of grammar is essentially stronger than type 2 grammars and has the advantage over type 1 grammars that the phrase structure of a grammatical sentence is unique, once the derivation is given.},

  abstract = {We introduce the relational ontology log, or relational olog, a knowledge representation system based on the category of sets and relations. It is inspired by Spivak and Kent's olog, a recent categorical framework for knowledge representation. Relational ologs interpolate between ologs and description logic, the dominant formalism for knowledge representation today. In this paper, we investigate relational ologs both for their own sake and to gain insight into the relationship between the algebraic and logical approaches to knowledge representation. On a practical level, we show by example that relational ologs have a friendly and intuitive--yet fully precise--graphical syntax, derived from the string diagrams of monoidal categories. We explain several other useful features of relational ologs not possessed by most description logics, such as a type system and a rich, flexible notion of instance data. In a more theoretical vein, we draw on categorical logic to show how relational ologs can be translated to and from logical theories in a fragment of first-order logic. Although we make extensive use of categorical language, this paper is designed to be self-contained and has considerable expository content. The only prerequisites are knowledge of first-order logic and the rudiments of category theory.},

However, in 2020 there remains a dearth of computational tools for working with SMCs. We present an "unbiased" approach to implementing symmetric monoidal categories, based on an operad of directed, acyclic wiring diagrams. Because the interchange law and other laws of a SMC hold identically in a wiring diagram, no rewrite rules are needed to compare diagrams. We discuss the mathematics of the operad of wiring diagrams, as well as its implementation in the software package Catlab.},

These grammars are based on a syntactic calculus, known as the Lambek calculus. Chomsky (1963) conjectured that these grammars are also equivalent to context-free ones. Every basic categorial grammar (and thus every context-free grammar) is equivalent to a Lambek grammar. Conversely, some special kinds of Lambek grammars are context-free. These grammars use weakly unidirectional types, or types of order at most two. The main result of this paper says that Lambek grammars generate only context-free languages. Thus they are equivalent to context-free grammars and also to basic categorial grammars. The Chomsky conjecture, that all languages recognized by the Lambek calculus are context-free, is thus proved.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  abstract = {Talk 1 by Alexis Toumi : Language Processing on Quantum Hardware with DisCoPy Abstract: String diagrams are a mathematical tool that describe the information flow both in categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) and natural language processing (NLP). DisCoPy (https://github.com/oxford-quantum-gro...) is a Python implementation of string diagrams, which we used to translate the grammatical structure of natural language onto the architecture of a quantum circuit: a proof-of-concept for quantum natural language processing (QNLP). I’ll give a short introduction to the category theory behind DisCoPy, followed by a demo where I’ll teach a quantum computer how to say “Alice loves Bob”. Bio: I’m a PhD student at the Quantum Group of the Computer Science depatment in Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Bob Coecke. I work at the intersection of natural language processing, quantum computing and category theory (a.k.a. general abstract nonsense). I’m also a Python programmer with some background in data science and deep learning for medieval paleography. Talk 2 by Procheta Sen: Socially Responsible AI: Cognitive Bias-Aware Multi-Objective Learning Abstract: Human society had a long history of suffering from cognitive biases leading to social prejudices and mass injustice. The prevalent existence of cognitive biases in large volumes of historical data can pose a threat of being manifested as unethical and seemingly inhumane predictions as outputs of AI systems trained on such data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bias-aware multi-objective learning framework that given a set of identity attributes (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and a subset of sensitive categories of the possible classes of prediction outputs, learns to reduce the frequency of predicting certain combinations of them, e.g. predicting stereotypes such as `most blacks use abusive language', or `fear is a virtue of women'. Our experiments conducted on an emotion prediction task with balanced class priors shows that a set of baseline bias-agnostic models exhibit cognitive biases with respect to gender, such as women are prone to be afraid whereas men are more prone to be angry. In contrast, our proposed bias-aware multi-objective learning methodology is shown to reduce such biases in the predicted emotions. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06618.pdf www.pydata.org    PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.

  abstract = {A combinatorial theory of associative \$n\$-categories has recently been proposed, with strictly associative and unital composition in all dimensions, and the weak structure arising as a combinatorial notion of homotopy with a natural geometrical interpretation. Such a theory has the potential to serve as an attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category theory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves proofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence. However, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies, which would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not therefore immediately amenable to implementation. We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which algorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of composite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial proofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of those proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for complex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it lifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a procedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any dimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that implements the theory of associative \$n\$-categories, and use it to construct a range of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.},

We propose a description of these non-square boxes, which we call open diagrams, in terms of coends and the monoidal bicategory of profunctors, with features of what could be considered a graphical calculus for these coends.

  abstract = {With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises, formalises and extends the link by systematically rephrasing quantum models as a kernel method. It shows that most near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. In particular, kernel-based training is guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.},

In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with \$2\$-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency.

We present a graphical language for dagger compact closed categories, and sketch a proof of its completeness for equational reasoning. We give a general construction, the CPM construction, which associates to each dagger compact closed category its “category of completely positive maps”, and we show that the resulting category is again dagger compact closed. We apply these ideas to Abramsky and Coecke's interpretation of quantum protocols, and to D'Hondt and Panangaden's predicate transformer semantics.},

In this process, we make "infinite use of finite means", enabling us to learn new concepts quickly and nest concepts within each-other. While program induction and synthesis remain at the heart of foundational theories of artificial intelligence, only recently has the community moved forward in attempting to use program learning as a benchmark task itself. The cognitive science community has thus often assumed that if the brain has simulation and reasoning capabilities equivalent to a universal computer, then it must employ a serialized, symbolic representation. Here we confront that assumption, and provide a counterexample in which compositionality is expressed via network structure: the free category prior over programs. We show how our formalism allows neural networks to serve as primitives in probabilistic programs. We learn both program structure and model parameters end-to-end.},

There has been great progress in the connectionist approach, and while it is still unclear whether the approach will succeed, it is also unclear exactly what the implications for cognitive science would be if it did succeed. In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approximate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist systems. The implication is that symbol-level structures provide only approximate accounts of cognition, useful for description but not necessarily for constructing detailed formal models.},

These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models.Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition.},

The technique is a formalization of the idea that a set of value/variable pairs can be represented by accumulating activity in a collection of units each of which computes the product of a feature of a variable and a feature of its value. The method allows the fully distributed representation of bindings and symbolic structures. Fully and partially localized special cases of the tensor product representation reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured data. The representation rests on a principled analysis of structure; it saturates gracefully as larger structures are represented; it permits recursive construction of complex representations from simpler ones; it respects the independence of the capacities to generate and maintain multiple bindings in parallel; it extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it permits values to also serve as variables; and it enables analysis of the interference of symbolic structures stored in associative memories. It has also served as the basis for working connectionist models of high-level cognitive tasks.},

Context sensitive rewrite grammars are syntactically, semantically and computationally unattractive. Generating grammars have a collection of nice properties that ensure they define only “mildly context sensitive” languages, and Joshi has proposed that human languages have those properties too. But for certain distinctive kinds of crossing dependencies in human languages, copying or matching analyses predominate.

However, every real-world implementation of such an algorithm must address numerous problems that have little to do with the actual algorithm, like handling input and output formats, formatting node texts, and styling nodes and edges. We present a new framework, implemented in the Lua programming language and integrated into the TikZ graphics description language, that aims at simplifying the implementation of graph drawing algorithms. Implementers using the framework can focus on the core algorithmic ideas and will automatically profit from the framework’s pre- and post-processing steps as well as from the extensive capabilities of the TikZ graphics language and the \textbackslash TeX\textbackslash TeX\{\textbackslash hbox\{\textbackslash TeX\}\} typesetting engine. Algorithms already implemented using the framework include the Reingold-Tilford tree drawing algorithm, a modular version of Sugiyama’s layered algorithm, and several force-based multilevel algorithms.},

  abstract = {Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

We further develop a formalism for understanding both classical as well as quantum linguistic problems and phrase them both as a Harmony optimization problem that can be solved on a quantum computer which we show is related to classifying vectors using quantum Boltzmann machines. We further provide a new training method for learning quantum Harmony operators that describe a language. This also provides a new algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines that requires no approximations and works in the presence of hidden units. We additionally show that quantum language processing is BQP-complete, meaning that it is polynomially equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computing which implies that quantum language models are richer than classical models unless BPP=BQP. It also implies that, under certain circumstances, quantum Boltzmann machines are more expressive than classical Boltzmann machines. Finally, we examine the performance of our approach numerically for the case of classical harmonic grammars and find that the method is capable of rapidly parsing even non-trivial grammars. This suggests that the work may have value as a quantum inspired algorithm beyond its initial motivation as a new quantum algorithm.},

  abstract = {Scaling up to a large number of qubits with high-precision control is essential in the demonstrations of quantum computational advantage to exponentially outpace the classical hardware and algorithmic improvements. Here, we develop a two-dimensional programmable superconducting quantum processor, Zuchongzhi, which is composed of 66 functional qubits in a tunable coupling architecture. To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature 574, 505 (2019). We estimate that the sampling task finished by Zuchongzhi in about 1.2 h will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 yr. Our work establishes an unambiguous quantum computational advantage that is infeasible for classical computation in a reasonable amount of time. The high-precision and programmable quantum computing platform opens a new door to explore novel many-body phenomena and implement complex quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {Given the rising popularity of quantum machine learning (QML), it is important to develop techniques that effectively simplify commonly adopted families of parameterised quantum circuits (commonly known as ans\textbackslash "\{a\}tze). This thesis pioneers the use of diagrammatic techniques to reason with QML ans\textbackslash "\{a\}tze. We take commonly used QML ans\textbackslash "\{a\}tze and convert them to diagrammatic form and give a full description of how these gates commute, making the circuits much easier to analyse and simplify. Furthermore, we leverage a combinatorial description of the interaction between CNOTs and phase gadgets to analyse a periodicity phenomenon in layered ans\textbackslash "\{a\}tze and also to simplify a class of circuits commonly used in QML.},

  abstract = {While the DisCoCat model (Coecke et al., 2010) has been proved a valuable tool for studying compositional aspects of language at the level of semantics, its strong dependency on pregroup grammars poses important restrictions: first, it prevents large-scale experimentation due to the absence of a pregroup parser; and second, it limits the expressibility of the model to context-free grammars. In this paper we solve these problems by reformulating DisCoCat as a passage from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to a category of semantics. We start by showing that standard categorial grammars can be expressed as a biclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity; we then proceed to model permutation-inducing rules by exploiting the symmetry of the compact closed category encoding the word meaning. We provide a proof of concept for our method, converting "Alice in Wonderland" into DisCoCat form, a corpus that we make available to the community.},

  abstract = {We develop a high-performance tensor-based simulator for random quantum circuits(RQCs) on the new Sunway supercomputer. Our major innovations include: (1) a near-optimal slicing scheme, and a path-optimization strategy that considers both complexity and compute density; (2) a three-level parallelization scheme that scales to about 42 million cores; (3) a fused permutation and multiplication design that improves the compute efficiency for a wide range of tensor contraction scenarios; and (4) a mixed-precision scheme to further improve the performance. Our simulator effectively expands the scope of simulatable RQCs to include the 10*10(qubits)*(1+40+1)(depth) circuit, with a sustained performance of 1.2 Eflops (single-precision), or 4.4 Eflops (mixed-precision)as a new milestone for classical simulation of quantum circuits; and reduces the simulation sampling time of Google Sycamore to 304 seconds, from the previously claimed 10,000 years.},

  abstract = {We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural language processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In (Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions.},

  abstract = {To ensure a long-term quantum computational advantage, the quantum hardware should be upgraded to withstand the competition of continuously improved classical algorithms and hardwares. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting quantum computing systems Zuchongzhi 2.1, which has 66 qubits in a two-dimensional array in a tunable coupler architecture. The readout fidelity of Zuchongzhi 2.1 is considerably improved to an average of 97.74\%. The more powerful quantum processor enables us to achieve larger-scale random quantum circuit sampling, with a system scale of up to 60 qubits and 24 cycles, and fidelity of FXEB=(3.66±0.345)×10-4. The achieved sampling task is about 6 orders of magnitude more difficult than that of Sycamore [Nature 574, 505 (2019)] in the classic simulation, and 3 orders of magnitude more difficult than the sampling task on Zuchongzhi 2.0 [arXiv:2106.14734 (2021)]. The time consumption of classically simulating random circuit sampling experiment using state-of-the-art classical algorithm and supercomputer is extended to tens of thousands of years (about 4.8×104 years), while Zuchongzhi 2.1 only takes about 4.2 hours, thereby significantly enhancing the quantum computational advantage.},
