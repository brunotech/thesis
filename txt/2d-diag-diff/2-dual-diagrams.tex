\subsection{Dual diagrams}\label{2-dual-diagrams}

Dual numbers were first introduced by Clifford~\cite{Clifford73}, they are a fundamental tool for \emph{automatic differentiation}~\cite{Hoffmann16}, i.e. they allow to compute the derivative of a function automatically from its definition.

Given a commutative rig $\S$, the rig of dual numbers $\D[\S]$ extends $\S$ by adjoining a new element $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon^2 = 0$.
Abstractly, $\D[\S] = \S[x] / x^2$ is a quotient of the rig of polynomials with coefficients in $\S$.
Concretely, elements of $\D[\S]$ are formal sums $s + s' \epsilon$ where $s$ and $s'$ are scalars in $\S$.
We write $\pi_0, \pi_1 : \D[\S] \to \S$
for the projection on the real and epsilon component respectively.
Addition and multiplication of dual numbers are given by:
\begin{align} \begin{split}\label{linearity}
(a + a' \ \epsilon ) + (b + b' \ \epsilon)
\quad &= \quad (a + b) \s + \s (a + b') \ \epsilon
\end{split}\\
\begin{split}\label{product-rule}
(a + a' \ \epsilon ) \times (b + b' \ \epsilon)
\quad &= \quad (a \times b) \s + \s (a \times b' \ + \ a' \times b) \ \epsilon
\end{split}
\end{align}

A related notion is that of \emph{differential rig}: a rig $\S$ equipped with a derivation, i.e. a map $\partial : \S \to \S$ which preserves sums and satisfies the Leibniz product rule
$\partial(f \times g) = f \times \partial(g) + \partial(f) \times g$ for all $f, g \in \S$.
An equivalent condition is that the map $f \mapsto f + (\partial f) \epsilon$ is a homomorphism of rigs $\S \to \D[\S]$.
The correspondance also works the other way around: given a homorphism $\partial : \S \to \D[\S]$ such that $\pi_0 \circ \partial = \id_\S$, projecting on the epsilon component is a derivation $\pi_1 \circ \partial : \S \to \S$.
The motivating example is the rig of smooth functions $\S = \R \to \R$, where differentiation is a derivation.
Concretely, we can extend any smooth function $f : \R \to \R$ to a function $f : \D[\R] \to \D[\R]$ over the dual numbers defined by:
\begin{equation}\label{dual-numbers-eq}
f(a + a' \epsilon) \quad = \quad f(a) \s + \s a' \times (\partial f)(a) \epsilon
\end{equation}

We can use equations~\ref{linearity}, \ref{product-rule} and \ref{dual-numbers-eq} to derive the usual rules for gradients in terms of dual numbers.
For the identity function we have $\id(a + a' \epsilon) = \id(a) + a' \epsilon$, i.e. $\partial \id = 1$.
For the constant functions we have $c(a + a' \epsilon) = c(a) + 0 \epsilon$, i.e. $\partial c = 0$.
For addition, multiplication and composition of functions, we can derive the following \emph{linearity}, \emph{product} and \emph{chain} rules:
\begin{align} \begin{split}
    (f + g)(a + a' \epsilon)
    \s &= \s (f + g)(a) \s + \s a' \times (\partial f + \partial g)(a) \epsilon
\end{split}\\ \begin{split}
    (f \times g)(a + a' \epsilon)
    \s &= \s (f \times g)(a) \s + \s a' \times (f \times \partial g \ + \ \partial f \times g)(a) \epsilon
\end{split}\\ \begin{split}
    (f \circ g)(a + a' \epsilon)
    \s &= \s (f \circ g)(a) \s + \s a' \times (\partial g \ \times \ \partial f \circ g)(a) \epsilon
\end{split} \end{align}

This generalises to smooth functions $\R^n \to \R^m$, where the partial derivative $\partial_i$ is a derivation for each $i < n$.
The functions $\F_2^n \to \F_2^m$ on the two-element field $\F_2$ with elementwise XOR as sum and conjunction as product also forms a differential rig.
The partial derivative is given by $(\partial_i f)(\vec{x}) = f(\vec{x}_{[x_i \mapsto 0]}) \oplus f(\vec{x}_{[x_i \mapsto 1]})$.
Intuitively, the $\F_2$ gradient $\partial_i f(\vec{x}) \in \F_2^m$ encodes which coordinates of $f(\vec{x})$ actually depend on the input $x_i$.
An example of differential rig that isn't also a ring is given by the set $\N[X]$ of polynomials with natural number coefficients, again each partial derivative is a derivation.

A more exotic example is the rig of Boolean functions with elementwise disjunction as sum and conjunction as product.
Boolean functions $\B^n \to \B^m$ can be represented as tuples of $m$ propositional formulae over $n$ variables.
The partial derivative $\partial_i$ for $i < n$ is defined by induction over the formulae:
for variables we have $\partial_i x_j = \delta_{ij}$, for constants $\partial_i 0 = \partial_i 1 = 0$ and for negation $\partial_i \neg \phi = \neg \partial_i \phi$. The derivative of disjunctions and conjunctions are given by the linerarity and product rules.
Equivalently, the gradient of a propositional formula can be given by $\partial_i \phi = \neg \phi_{[x_i \mapsto 0]} \land \phi_{[x_i \mapsto 1]}$.
Concretely, a model satisfies $\partial_i \phi$ if and only if it satisfies $\phi \leftrightarrow x_i$: the derivative is true when the variable and the formula are positively correlated.
Substituting $x_i$ with its negation, we get that a model satisfies $\partial_i \phi_{[x_i \mapsto \neg x_i]}$ if and only if it satisfies $\phi \leftrightarrow \neg x_i$, i.e. iff variable and formula are anti-correlated.
Note that although $\B$ and $\F_2$ are isomorphic as sets, they are distinct rigs.
Their derivations are related however by $\partial^{\F_2}_i f \mapsto \partial^\B_i \phi \lor \partial^\B_i \phi_{[x_i \mapsto \neg x_i]}$ for $\phi : \B^n \to \B$ the formula corresponding to the function $f : \F_2^n \to \F_2$.
That is, a Boolean function depends on an input variable precisely when either the corresponding formula is positively correlated or anti-correlated.

Our main technical contribution is to generalise dual numbers and derivations from rigs to monoidal categories with sums.
Given a monoidal category $C$ with sums (i.e. enriched in commutative monoids), we define the category $\D[C]$ by adjoining a scalar (i.e. an endomorphism of the monoidal unit) $\epsilon$ and quotienting by\footnote{
In the case when $C$ is not braided we also require the axiom $\epsilon \otimes f = f \otimes \epsilon$.
} $\epsilon \otimes \epsilon = 0$.
Concretely, the objects of $\D[C]$ are the same as those of $C$, the arrows
are given by formal sums $f + f' \epsilon$ of parallel arrows $f, f' \in C$.
Composition and tensor are both given by the product rule:
\begin{align}
    (f + f' \epsilon) \ \fcmp \ (g + g' \epsilon)
    &\s = \s f \ \fcmp \ g \s + \s (f' \fcmp g \ + \ f \fcmp g') \ \epsilon\\
    (f + f' \epsilon) \otimes (g + g' \epsilon)
    &\s = \s f \otimes g \s + \s (f' \otimes g \ + \ f \otimes g') \ \epsilon
\end{align}

We say that a unary operator on homsets $\partial : \coprod_{x,y} C(x, y) \to C(x, y)$ is a derivation whenever it satisfies the product rules for both composition
$\partial (f \fcmp g) = (\partial f) \fcmp g + f \fcmp (\partial g)$ and tensor
$\partial (f \otimes g) = (\partial f) \otimes g + f \otimes (\partial g)$.
An equivalent condition is that the map $f \mapsto f + (\partial f) \epsilon$ is a sum-preserving monoidal functor $C \to \D[C]$.
Again, the correspondance between dual numbers and derivations works the other way around: given a sum-preserving monoidal functor $\partial : C \to \D[C]$ such that
$\pi_0 \circ \partial = \id_{C}$, projecting on the epsilon component gives a derivation $\pi_1 \circ \partial : \coprod_{x,y} C(x, y) \to C(x, y)$.
The following propositions characterise the derivations on the category of matrices valued in a commutative rig $\S$.

\begin{proposition}
Dual matrices are matrices of dual numbers, i.e. we have $\D[\mathbf{Mat}_\S] \simeq \mathbf{Mat}_{\D[\S]}$ for all commutative rigs $\S$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The isomorphism is given by
$$\big( \sum_{ij} f_{ij} \ket{j} \bra{i} \big)
\ + \ \big( f'_{ij} \sum_{ij} \ket{j}  \bra{i} \big) \epsilon
\s \longleftrightarrow \s
\sum_{ij} (f_{ij} + f'_{ij} \epsilon) \ket{j} \bra{i}$$
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Derivations on $\mathbf{Mat}_\S$ are in one-to-one correspondance with
derivations on $\S$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
A derivation on $\mathbf{Mat}_\S$ is uniquely determined by its action on
scalars in $\S$. Conversely, applying a derivation $\partial : \S \to \S$
entrywise on matrices yields a derivation on $\mathbf{Mat}_\S$.
\end{proof}

DisCoPy implements parameterised matrices with SymPy~\cite{MeurerEtAl17} expressions as entries.
The method \py{Tensor.grad} takes a SymPy variable and applies element-wise symbolic differentiation.

\begin{python}
{\normalfont Implementation of gradients of parameterised tensors with SymPy.}

\begin{minted}{python}
def grad(self: Tensor[sympy.Expr], var: sympy.Symbol):
    return self.map(lambda x: x.diff(var))

Tensor.grad = grad
\end{minted}
\end{python}

\begin{example}
We can check the product rule for tensor and composition of matrices.

\begin{minted}{python}
x = sympy.Symbol('x')
f = Tensor([[x + 1, 2 * x], [x ** 2, 1 / x     ]], [2], [2])
g = Tensor([[1,     2],     [2 * x, -1 / x ** 2]], [2], [2])

assert f.grad(x) == g
assert (f @ g).grad(x)  == f.grad(x) @ g  +  f @ g.grad(x)
assert (f >> g).grad(x) == f.grad(x) >> g + f >> g.grad(x)
\end{minted}
\end{example}

Fix a monoidal signature $\Sigma$ and let $C_\Sigma^+$ be the free monoidal category with sums that it generates, i.e. arrows are formal sums of diagrams as defined in sections~\ref{subsection:dagger-sums-bubbles} and \ref{subsection:monoidal-daggers-sums-bubbles}.
We assume our diagrams are interpreted as matrices, i.e. we fix a sum-preserving monoidal functor $[\![-]\!]  : C_\Sigma^+ \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$ for $\S$ a commutative rig with a derivation $\partial : \S \to \S$.
Our main two examples are the ZX-calculus of Coecke and Duncan~\cite{CoeckeDuncan08} with smooth functions $\R^n \to \R$ as phases and the algebraic ZX-calculus over $\S$, introduced by Wang~\cite{Wang20}.

Applying the dual number construction to $C_\Sigma^+$, we get the category of \emph{dual diagrams} $\D[C_\Sigma^+]$ which is where diagrammatic differentiation happens.
By the universal property of $C_\Sigma^+$, every derivation $\partial : C_\Sigma^+ \to \D[C_\Sigma^+]$ is uniquely determined by its image on the generating boxes in $\Sigma_1$.
Intuitively, if we're given the derivative for each box, we can compute the derivative for every sum of diagram using the product rule.
We say that the interpretation $[\![-]\!] : C_\Sigma^+ \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$ admits diagrammatic differentiation if there is a derivation $\partial$ on $C_\Sigma^+$ such that $[\![-]\!] \circ \partial = \partial \circ [\![-]\!]$.
That is, the interpretation of the gradient $[\![\partial d]\!]$ coincides with the gradient of the interpretation $\partial [\![d]\!]$ for all sums of diagrams $d \in C_\Sigma^+$.
We depict the gradient $\partial d$ as a bubble surrounding the diagram $d$, as discussed in sections~\ref{subsection:dagger-sums-bubbles} and \ref{subsection:monoidal-daggers-sums-bubbles}.
Once translated to string diagrams, the axioms for derivations on monoidal
categories with sums become:
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-1a-product-rule}
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-1b-product-rule}

We implement dual diagrams with a method \py{Diagram.grad} which takes SymPy variables and returns formal sums of diagrams by applying the product rules for tensor and composition.
By default, we assume that boxes are constant, i.e. their gradient is the empty sum.

\begin{python}
{\normalfont Implementation of dual diagrams.}

\begin{minted}{python}
Box.grad = lambda self, var: Sum([], self.dom, self.cod)

def grad(self: Diagram, var: sympy.Symbol):
    if len(self) == 0: return Sum([], self.dom, self.cod)
    left, box, right = self.layers[0]
    return left @ box.grad(var) @ right >> self[1:]\
        + left @ box @ right >> self[1:].grad(var)

Diagram.grad = grad
\end{minted}
\end{python}

\begin{example}
We can override the default \py{grad} method and check the product rule for diagrams.

\begin{minted}{python}
class DataBox(Box):
    def __init__(self, name: str, dom: Ty, cod: Ty, data: sympy.Expr):
        self.data = data
        super().__init__(name, dom, cod)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, DataBox): return super().__eq__(other)
        return super().__eq__(other) and self.data == other.data

    def grad(self, var):
        return DataBox(self.name, self.dom, self.cod, self.data.diff(var))

phi = sympy.Symbol('\\phi')
x, y, z = map(Ty, "xyz")
f, g = DataBox('f', x, y, phi ** 2), DataBox('g', y, z, 1 / phi)

assert (f @ g).grad(phi) == f.grad(phi) @ g + f @ g.grad(phi)
assert (f >> g).grad(phi) == f.grad(phi) >> g + f >> g.grad(phi)
\end{minted}
\end{example}

\subsection{Differentiating the ZX-calculus}\label{2b-differentiating-zx}

This section applies the dual number construction to the diagrams of the ZX-calculus with smooth functions $\alpha : \R^n \to \R$ as phases.
For each number of variables $n \in \N$, we define $\mathbf{ZX}_n$ as the free symmetric category generated by the signature:
$$\Sigma_0 = \{ x \} \s \text{and} \s \Sigma_1 = \{ H : x \to x \} + \{ Z^{m, n}(\alpha) : x^{\otimes m} \to x^{\otimes n} \ \vert \ m, n \in \N, \alpha : \R^n \to \R \}$$
where $H$ is depicted as a yellow box and $Z^{m, n}(\alpha)$ as a green spider.
The red spider is syntactic sugar for a green spider with yellow boxes connected to each leg.
The interpretation $[\![-]\!]  : \mathbf{ZX}_n \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$ in matrices over $\S = \R^n \to \C$ is given by on objects by $[\![ x ]\!] = 2$ and on arrows by
$[\![ H ]\!] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{0}\bra{0} + \ket{0}\bra{1} + \ket{1}\bra{0} - \ket{1}\bra{1}\big)$
and $[\![Z^{m, n}(\alpha)]\!] =
e^{-i \alpha / 2} \ket{0}^{\otimes n} \bra{0}^{\otimes m}
+ e^{i \alpha / 2} \ket{1}^{\otimes n} \bra{1}^{\otimes m}$.
Note that we've scaled the standard interpretation of the green spider by a global phase to match the usual definition of rotation gates in quantum circuits.
For $n = 0$ we get $\mathbf{ZX}_0 = \mathbf{ZX}$ the ZX-calculus with no parameters.
By currying, any ZX diagram $d \in \mathbf{ZX}_n$ can be seen as a function $d : \R^n \to \text{Ar}(\mathbf{ZX})$ such that $[\![-]\!] \circ d : \R^n \to \mathbf{Mat}_\C$ is smooth.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-scalars}
A function $s : \R^n \to \C$ can be drawn as a scalar diagram in $\mathbf{ZX}_n$ if and only if it is bounded.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Generalising \cite[P.~8.101]{CoeckeKissinger17} to parametrised scalars, if there is a $k \in \N$ with $\vert s(\theta) \vert \leq 2^k$ for all $\theta \in \R^n$ then there are parametrised phases $\alpha, \beta : \R^n \to \R$ such that

\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-2-bounded-lemma}

In the other direction, take any scalar diagram $d$ in $\mathbf{ZX}_n$.
Let $k$ be the number of spider in the diagram and $l$ the maximum number
of legs. By decomposing each spider as a sum of two disconnected diagrams,
we can write $d$ as a sum of $2^k$ diagrams. Each term of the sum is a product
of at most $\frac{1}{2} \times k \times l$ bone-shaped scalars. Each bone is
bounded by $2$, thus $[\![d]\!] : \R^n \to \C$ is bounded by $2^{k \times l}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma-rotations}
In $\mathbf{ZX}_n$, we have $\tikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-3a-lemma-rotation}$
for all affine $\alpha : \R^n \to \R$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Because $\alpha$ is affine we have that $\partial \alpha$ is constant, hence bounded and from lemma~\ref{lemma-scalars} we know it can be drawn in $\mathbf{ZX}_n$.
\begin{align*}
\partial [\![ Z(\alpha) ]\!]
&= \partial \big( e^{-i \alpha / 2} \ket{0}+ e^{i \alpha / 2} \ket{1}\big)\\
&= \frac{i\partial\alpha}{2}\big(-e^{-i \alpha / 2} \ket{0} + e^{i\alpha / 2} \ket{1}\big)\\
&= \frac{\partial\alpha}{2}\big(e^{-i\frac{\alpha+\pi}{2}} \ket{0} + e^{i\frac{\alpha+\pi}{2}} \ket{1}\big)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem-zx-diag-diff}
The ZX-calculus with affine maps $\R^n \to \R$ as phases admits diagrammatic
differentiation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The Hadamard $H$ has derivative zero.
For the green spiders, we can extend lemma~\ref{lemma-rotations} from
single qubit rotations to arbitrary many legs using spider fusion:
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-4-zx-theorem}
\end{proof}

Note that there is no diagrammatic differentiation for the ZX-calculus with
smooth maps as phases, even when restricted to bounded functions.
Take for example $\alpha : \R \to \R$ with $\alpha(\theta) = \sin \theta^2$,
it is smooth and bounded by $1$ but its derivative $\partial \alpha$ is
unbounded.
Thus, from lemma~\ref{lemma-scalars} we know it cannot be represented as a
scalar diagram in $\mathbf{ZX}_1$: there can be no diagrammatic
differentiation $\partial : \mathbf{ZX}_1 \to \D[\mathbf{ZX}_1]$.
In such cases, we can always extend the signature by adjoining a new box
for each derivative.

\begin{proposition}
For every interpretation $[\![-]\!] : C_\Sigma^+ \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$,
there is an extended signature $\Sigma' \supset \Sigma$
and interpretation $[\![-]\!] : C_{\Sigma'}^+ \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$
such that $C_{\Sigma'}^+$ admits digrammatic differentiation.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Sigma' = \cup_{n \in \N} \Sigma^n$ where $\Sigma^0 = \Sigma$
and $\Sigma^{n + 1} = \Sigma^n \cup \{ \partial f \ \vert \ f \in \Sigma^n \}$
with $[\![\partial f]\!] = \partial [\![f]\!]$.
\end{proof}

The issue of being able to represent arbitrary scalars disappears if we work
with the algebraic ZX-calculus instead. Furthermore, we can generalise
from $\S = \R^n \to \C$ to any commutative rig.
We define the category $\mathbf{ZX}_\S$ as the free symmetric category generated by the signature given in \cite[Table~2]{Wang20} and the interpretation $[\![-]\!] : \mathbf{ZX}_\S \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$ given in \cite[§6]{Wang20}.
In particular, there is a green square $R_Z^{m, n}(a) \in \Sigma_1$ for each $a \in \S$ and $m, n \in \N$ with interpretation
$$[\![R_Z^{m, n}(a)]\!] = \ket{0}^{\otimes n} \bra{0}^{\otimes m} + a \ket{1}^{\otimes n} \bra{1}^{\otimes m}$$
Let $\mathbf{ZX}_\S^+$ be the category of formal sums of algebraic ZX
diagrams over $\S$.

\begin{theorem}
Diagrammatic derivations for the interpretation $[\![-]\!] : \mathbf{ZX}_\S^+ \to \mathbf{Mat}_\S$
are in one-to-one correspondance with rig derivations $\partial : \S \to \S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Given a derivation $\partial$ on $\S$, we have
$\partial [\![R_Z^{m, n}(a)]\!]
= (\partial a) \ket{1}^{\otimes n} \bra{1}^{\otimes m}$
and $\partial a$ can be represented by the scalar diagram
$R_Z^{1, 0}(\partial a) \ket{1}$.
In the other direction, a diagrammatic derivation $\partial$ on
$\mathbf{ZX}_\S^+$ is uniquely determined by its action on scalars
$R_Z^{1, 0}(a) \ket{1}$ for $a \in \S$.
\end{proof}

One application of diagrammatic differentiation is to solve
differential equations between diagrams. As a first step,
we apply Stone's theorem \cite{Stone32} on one-parameter unitary groups
to the ZX-calculus.

\begin{definition}
A one-parameter unitary group is a unitary matrix $U : n \to n$
in $\mathbf{Mat}_{\R \to \C}$ with $U(0) = \id_n$ and $U(\theta) U(\theta') = U(\theta + \theta')$
for all $\theta, \theta' \in \R$. It is strongly continuous when
$\lim_{\theta \to \theta_0} U(\theta) = U(\theta_0)$ for all $\theta_0 \in \R$.
We say a one-parameter diagram $d : x^{\otimes n} \to x^{\otimes n}$
is a unitary group if its interpretation $[\![d]\!]$ is.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The interpretation of diagrams with smooth maps as phases are necessarily strongly continuous.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Stone]
There is a one-to-one correspondance between strongly continuous one-parameter
unitary groups $U : n \to n$ in $\mathbf{Mat}_{\R \to \C}$ and self-adjoint
matrices $H : n \to n$ in $\mathbf{Mat}_{\C}$. The bijection is given
explicitly by $U(\theta) = \exp(i \theta H)$ and $H = - i (\partial U)(0)$,
translated in terms of diagrams with bubbles we get:
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-5-stone-theorem}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
A one-parameter diagram $d : x^{\otimes n} \to x^{\otimes n}$ in
$\mathbf{ZX}_1$ is a unitary group iff there is a constant
self-adjoint diagram
$h : x^{\otimes n} \to x^{\otimes n}$ such that $\partial d = i h \fcmp d$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Given the diagram for a unitary group $d$, we compute its diagrammatic
differentiation $\partial d$ and get $h$ by pattern matching.
Conversely given a self-adjoint $h$, the diagram $d = \exp(i \theta h)$
is a unitary group.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Let $d = R_z(\alpha) \otimes R_x(\alpha)$ for a smooth $\alpha : \R \to \R$, then the following implies $d(\theta) = \exp(i \theta h)$ for $h = - i \frac{\partial \alpha}{2}(Z \otimes I + I \otimes X)$.
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-6-simple-example}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $d = P(\alpha, ZX)$ be a Pauli gadget as in \cite[Definition~4.1]{CowtanEtAl20a} then
the following implies
$d(\theta) = \exp(i \theta h)$ for $h = -i \frac{\partial \alpha}{2} Z \otimes X$.
\ctikzfig{img/diag-diff/2-7-pauli-gadget}
\end{example}
