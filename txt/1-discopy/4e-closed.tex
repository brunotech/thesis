Cartesian monoid implies bialgebra, bialgebra and Frobenius imply trivial

$\mathbf{Pyth}$ cannot be be rigid but it does share a common structure with rigid categories: both are \emph{biclosed categories}...

A category is \emph{cartesian closed} when it is both cartesian and biclosed.

Listing: \py{closed}

Listing: closed structure on \py{rigid.Diagram}

Listing: $\mathbf{Pyth}$ as a cartesian closed category

Example: preordered monoids that are also biclosed categories, categorial grammars and Montague semantics, see section~\ref{section:NLP}.
