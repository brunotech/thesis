\begin{abstract}
This thesis introduces a framework for quantum natural language processing (QNLP) based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement.
The grammar of a sentence connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement connects the states of quantum systems, they are both structures of information flow.
We turn this language-to-qubit analogy into an algorithm that maps the grammatical structure of sentences onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits.
We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in some data-driven task.
The implementation of these QNLP models led to the development of DisCoPy, a Python toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview.
The second chapter defines QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits.
It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data.
In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation, a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of quantum circuits and parameterised diagrams in general.
