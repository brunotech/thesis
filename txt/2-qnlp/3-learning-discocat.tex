\section{Training QNLP models}

In the previous section, we have showed how to evaluate a given DisCoCat model on a quantum computer.
But where do we get this model from in the first place?
This section will review previous approaches to solving this problem and how we can adapt them to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.
