\chapter{Quantum natural language processing} \label{chapter-2:qnlp}

This chapter introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models as monoidal functors from grammar to quantum circuits.
Building on the previous chapter, we show how to implement QNLP models in DisCoPy and how to train them to solve NLP tasks such as classification and question answering.
