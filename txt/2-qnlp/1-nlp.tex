\section{Natural language processing with DisCoPy}\label{section:NLP}

The previous chapter has put much emphasis on the concept of \emph{string diagram} and its role at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, as the arrows of free monoidal categories on one side, and on the other as a two-dimensional generalisation of lists, which may describe the run of a Turing machine, the syntax of a first-order logic formula or the architecture of a neural network.
In fact, we will see that string diagrams also play a key role in linguistics, where they allow to encode \emph{grammatical structure}.


% \subsection{Pregroup grammars and DisCoCat models}
%
% \cite{Lambek99,Lambek01,Lambek08}
%
% as arrows in free rigid categories~\cite{PrellerLambek07}
%
% DisCoCat models as functors into matrices
%
% Frobenius algebras for functional words
%
% Other kinds of semantics:
%
% \subsection{Dependency grammars}
%
% \cite{Gaifman65}
%
% as context-free grammars
%
% as pregroup grammars with \emph{functional} or \emph{operadic} signatures
