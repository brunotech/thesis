\section{Natural language processing with DisCoPy}\label{section:NLP}

The previous chapter has put much emphasis on the concept of \emph{string diagram} and its role at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, as the arrows of free monoidal categories on one side, and on the other as a two-dimensional generalisation of lists, which may describe the run of a Turing machine, the syntax of a first-order logic formula or the architecture of a neural network.
In fact, we will see that string diagrams also play a key role in linguistics, where they allow to encode \emph{grammatical structure}.
